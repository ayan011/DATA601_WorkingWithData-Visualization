    "\n",
    "## Question 1 (15 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing empirically determined frequencies to a model \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Motivation: \n",
    "It is useful to compare a theoretical distribution visually with a data set to examine if an assumptions about the data is true, this problem provides you an exercises in this comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tools: \n",
    "For this question you may use `NumPy` and `matplotlib`. You may also use any built-in data structures or functions. However, please do not use `pandas`. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Overview:\n",
    "This question asks you to perform a frequency analysis on the first letter of words in the novel \"Moby Dick\" by Herman Melville, and compare the result with the first letter law (FLL) inspired by Benford's law. For visual comparison, you are asked to graph the result obtained along with the theoretical result to determine how closely the results match.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "##### Background: \n",
    "\n",
    "[Benfordâ€™s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law) describes the expected frequency of the leading digit in a set of numbers. Inspired by this law, [Yan et al. (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437118310768) have recently proposed a First Letter Law (FLL) that predicts the percentages of first letters in novels. \n",
    "\n",
    "An overview of FLL in the context of the English language (26 letters) is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability $p_i$ of the $i$-th ($1 \\le i \\le 26$) most frequently occurring letter in a novel is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_i = \\frac{26 - 25\\log_{26}25 - i \\log_{26} i + (i-1) \\log_{26} (i-1)}\n",
    "           {26 \\cdot 25 \\log_{26} (\\tfrac{26}{25})}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the most frequently occurring letter ($i=1$) in an English novel appears with probability:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_1 = \\frac{1 + 25 \\log_{26}(\\tfrac{26}{25})}{26 \\cdot 25 \\log_{26}(\\tfrac{26}{25})}.\n",
